House Prices Advanced Regression: My Approach

By: Brian Rafferty

This project is my submission for the Kaggle Competition titled "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". The goal of the project was to use linear regression to predict housing prices based upon a series of property characteristics. To accomplish my goals, I employed exploratory data analysis (statistical analysis and data visualization), data cleaning (imputing, encoding, and scaling), and machine learning (testing, evaluating, tuning, and predicting).
